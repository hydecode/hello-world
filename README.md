Hello World example

I enjoy spending time in the Appalachian mountains.
I like all things nature and being around all kinds of wild animals like deer, turkeys and bears.
I enjoy hiking and white water rafting.
I love the fall season and the color change, especially in the mountains.
A little bit of snow is fun but when it gets very cold I'm ready to return to Florida.
In Florida, I enjoy the beach and boating.
